# Django-trening or django-training
This is my first experiment with django (exactly, the second one). I have retrained a tutorial of an interesting person, Gosha Dudar. In addition, I tried to use my new skill to write Russian characters simply by keyboard with another language, like here: Привет всем! Здравствуйте, господин Дударь! Oh, it was hard work, and many mistakes...
